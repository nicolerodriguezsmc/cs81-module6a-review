The following are my reflections:

* What was the hardest part to understand?

The hardest part was getting how "this" works in the code. At times it could be confusing to know how exactly the computer "knew" what "this" was.

* How does this code use this to tie data and behavior together?

The code uses this to refer to the current playlist. "This" allows functions to access the properties of the current Plalist and modify them.

* What would you do differently if you wrote this from scratch?

To be honest, I'm not sure what I would do differently if I wrote this from scratch. But, if I were to continue adding to the code, maybe it would be helpful to write functions that allowed you to delete songs from the playlist, play the previous song, play a specific song, or perhaps even move a song to a different spot in the array.
